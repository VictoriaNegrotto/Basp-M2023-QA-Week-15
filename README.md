# Sauce Demo e2e

## About the project
I worked with the `Web Driver Io` for automatin test on the project `Sauce Demo` along with `Jasmin`.

In `page objects` I put all the elements to be used in the e2e, then in `test` the flows made by the user.

## Scope
`Login Page` for different user on the failed path and happy path for login.

`Home Page` where I make a happy path about `Login, Home Page and Shopping, Logout` and finished the path of the user on `Sauce Demo`.

## Objetive
The idea is to cover the `happy path` on the purchase of a product from the moment of Login until ending in Logout.
On the other hand, having a way of seeing what could go wrong when a user wants to Login.

## Install
Download the project from this repository.
Open Git Bash terminal on project folder.
Run npm install on the terminal to install every dependency of package.json
In order to carry out these automation tests, we use the Wdio framework and to be able to run the tests, we must first install it with the command: `npm init --save-dev wdio` in Visual Code, then in the git terminal you can run the test with the command: `npx wdio`.

## Week-15
Automation about `Standad User` and `Problem User` on `Happy Path` on  `Sauce Demo`.
I try to fix the automation about las week `Week-14`.
