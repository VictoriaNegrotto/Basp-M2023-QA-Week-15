# Sauce Demo e2e

## About the project
I worked with the `Web Driver Io` for automatin test on the project `Sauce Demo` along with `Jasmin`.

In `page objects` I put all the elements to be used in the e2e, then in `test` the flows made by the user.

## Scope
`Login Page` for different user on the failed path and happy path for login.

`Home Page` where I make a happy path about `Login, Home Page and Shopping, Logout` and finished the path of the user on `Sauce Demo`.

## Objetive
The idea is to cover the `happy path` on the purchase of a product from the moment of Login until ending in Logout.
On the other hand, having a way of seeing what could go wrong when a user wants to Login.

## Install
In order to carry out these automation tests, we use the Wdio framework and to be able to run the tests, we must first install it with the command: `npm init --save-dev wdio` in Visual Code, then in the git terminal you can run the test with the command: `npx wdio`.
